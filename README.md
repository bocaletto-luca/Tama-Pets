## Features

- **Real-Time Pet Status:**  
  Displays Hunger, Happiness, Energy, and Cleanliness with progress bars and single-decimal precision.
  
- **Virtual Clock & Day Counter:**  
  Every 5 real seconds equals 1 virtual hour. After 24 virtual hours, Days Alive increases; an icon shows ‚òÄÔ∏è (06:00‚Äì18:00) or üåô (otherwise).

- **Interactive Actions:**  
  Use buttons for Feed, Play, Sleep, Clean, and Park. The corresponding action text and emoticon appear beneath the pet image.

- **Save & Load Functionality:**  
  Save game state automatically to localStorage (every 10 seconds and on page unload) and manually via file download/upload. The load feature resets the file input so you can use it repeatedly.

- **Record Management:**  
  When your pet dies (if Hunger and Energy are 0), the game stops and your record (name and days survived) is stored on the server. View the leaderboard with the "Record" button.

- **Gamepad Support:**  
  Basic support (with 250ms debounce) simulates key events for improved playability.

2. **Server Setup:**

- Ensure you have a PHP-enabled server (such as Apache).

## Usage
